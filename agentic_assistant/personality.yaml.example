# personality.yaml — example personality configuration

# Copy this file to personality.yaml and customise the values.
# When PERSONALITY_FILE=./personality.yaml is set in .env (or the file
# exists at the default path), these values override the corresponding
# AGENT_* environment variables.
#
# All fields are optional.  Omitting a field causes the AGENT_* env var
# (or its built-in default) to be used instead.
